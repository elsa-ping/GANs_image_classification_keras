# Image Classification and GANs with Keras

This is the repository for my capstone while attending General Assembly's Data Science Immersive course. The goal of this project is to create an image classifier for different categories of clothes in addition to diving a bit into generative adversarial models. <br/><br/>
The first dataset utilized is a csv containing grayscale images. This image classifier will be using CNNs and Keras to predict categories of clothes. The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist/data. <br/>
