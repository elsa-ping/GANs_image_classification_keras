# FashionMNIST

This is the repository for my capstone, Not Pants! The goal of this project is to create an image classifier for different categories of clothes. <br/><br/>
The first dataset utilized is a csv containing grayscale images. This image classifier will be using CNNs and Keras to predict categories of clothes. The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist/data. <br/>
I've began to create a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) that has not been complete yet. Feel free to take a look, but it's a work in progress!
